# etherminal

There's nothing have done for this product. Please be careful.

We deny some of preceding concept for creative destruction.

## A new language

Bash-like languages are old. We bring modern, safe, easy language to use.

### Structural Typing

The shell is string-ish zone. But it should be a type-safe zone to catch error early.

### Graphical

Nowadays, shell is everyday product for programmers. It should be more intuitive.

### No Mutation

That confuses human.

### Isolated

That confuses human.

## A new terminal

Actuall is not a something new. But strongly integrated with the language.

### Auto-completion

We really need it. [Fig](https://fig.io) and [Warp](https://warp.dev) does.

### Description

Show description of commands, sub-commands, flags.

### Manual

Open man in terminal.

### Node Editing

Not only text coding but also visual coding.

### Sharing

Real-time terminal collaboration, record terminal, etc.

### Notebook

Like jupyter, it should can be runnable in some notebook.

## Prompt

Like p10k, easily configurable & pluggable.
Also, should support default plugin like highlight

I like async.
